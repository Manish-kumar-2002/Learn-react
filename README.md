## What is a CDN?

- **A Content Delivery Network or Content Distribution Network**: "(CDN) is a distributed network of servers that helps deliver content faster by serving it from the nearest location to the user. It improves performance, reduces server load, enhances security, and ensures better availability of web applications."

## Why do we use a CDN?

- **Faster Load Times:** Since the content is served from the nearest server, it reduces latency and improves page speed.
- **Reduced Server Load:** CDN distributes traffic across multiple servers, preventing overloading of the origin server.
- **Better Availability & Reliability:** Even if one server goes down, another server in the network can serve the content.
- **Improved Security:** CDNs provide DDoS protection, secure data transfer, and reduce the risk of cyberattacks.
- **SEO Benefits:** Faster load times improve user experience, which can positively impact search engine rankings.

## What is crossorigin and why do we use it in React CDN ?

### crossorigin

The crossorigin attribute is used in HTML <script> and <link> tags to handle cross-origin requests (i.e., requests made to a different domain). It tells the browser how to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) when loading external resources like scripts, stylesheets, and images.

### Why do we use crossorigin in React CDN

#### When using React via a CDN (e.g., loading React from a public URL like "https://unpkg.com/react"), the crossorigin attribute ensures:

- **Proper Error Handling in DevTools:** Without crossorigin="anonymous", if there's an error in a React script loaded from a CDN, the browser may block the error details due to security policies.With crossorigin="anonymous", the browser allows detailed error messages, helping in debugging.
- **Optimized Performance with Caching:** If multiple websites load React from the same CDN with crossorigin="anonymous", browsers can reuse the cached version instead of downloading it again.
- **Security & CORS Compliance:** It ensures that external scripts follow CORS policies, preventing unauthorized access to user data.

## What is react.development.js and react-dom.development.js?

### When using React via a CDN, you will find two main JavaScript files:

- **react.development.js:** This file is the core React library for development mode, This file contains the whole code of React which is written in JavaScript
- **react-dom.development.js:** The library responsible for rendering React components in the browser DOM (for web applications).

---

## What is the difference between react.development.js and react.production.js via CDN ?

- **react.development.js:** Used for development (debugging-friendly).
- **react.production.js:** Used for production (optimized for performance).

### Example: Using React via CDN
```
<!-- Development Mode (for debugging) -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

<!-- Production Mode (for performance) -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>

```

## What is the difference between a framework and a library ?

### framework

- **Definition**: A collection of functions and utilities that developers can call when needed.
- **Control**: Developer controls when and how to use the library.
- **Flexibility**: More flexible; can be used with different frameworks.
- **Examples**: ReactJS (Library), jQuery, Axios

### Library

- **Definition**: A complete structure that provides rules, architecture, and tools to build applications.
- **Control**: Framework controls the flow; the developer follows its structure.
- **Flexibility**: Less flexible; enforces a specific way of building apps.
- **Examples**: Angular, Next.js, Django, Spring Boot

## Why is React named ‚ÄúReact‚Äù ?

- React is named "React" because it is designed to react efficiently to changes in data and update the UI dynamically.

### Reason Behind the Name

- Efficient UI Updates
- Virtual DOM Optimization
- Reactive Programming Approach: meaning the UI updates in response to state changes.

---

## What is the difference between React and React-dom ?

-**React** (react) is the core library used for building UI components and handling state. -**React-DOM** (react-dom) is specifically for rendering React components into the browser‚Äôs DOM.

- React can be used in different environments (like React Native), but React-DOM is specific to web applications.

---

## Explain the difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM ?

- The **Real DOM** is the actual structure of the webpage, but modifying it directly is slow.
- React uses a **Virtual DOM**, which is a lightweight copy of the Real DOM, to optimize performance.
- When changes occur, React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one **(using a diffing algorithm)**
- and updates only the necessary parts in the Real DOM instead of reloading the entire page.

---

## When does React sync the changes of Virtual DOM with Real DOM ?

- React syncs the Virtual DOM with the Real DOM whenever the state or props change, causing a component to re-render.
- **It follows a two-phase process**:
  - React updates the Virtual DOM and finds the differences "Reconciliation" (Render Phase),
  - then it applies the minimal necessary changes to the Real DOM (Commit Phase). This makes React efficient and avoids unnecessary updates.

### React Update Lifecycle: Render Phase vs. Commit Phase

#### Render Phase (Reconciliation Phase)

- React creates a new Virtual DOM when state or props change.
- It compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one (Diffing Algorithm).
- React does not touch the Real DOM in this phase.
- This phase is pure (no side effects like DOM updates or API calls).

#### Commit Phase

- React applies the necessary updates to the Real DOM.
- Runs side effects (useEffect, componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate).
- Updates UI and triggers re-renders if required.




# `Learn React With Harshi üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Series`

Documenting my learning journey of [Namaste React Live Course](https://learn.namastedev.com/) conducted by Akshay Saini

## Namaste React Project Setup Cheatsheet

Following are the steps that we followed (in namaste react course) while developing a React App. You don't have to jump to multiple websites to copy setup command. Simply, you can refer to this cheatsheet for commands & configuration steps and easily create any new React Application.

### Important Note

You can follow these steps when you want to learn React in depth and want to know what happens behind the scene of create-react-app. But when you are in time constraint to develop a react app in situations like machine coding round of interview, it's advisable to use create-react-app package which does most of the below steps in less time. If you want to know how to setup the react application with create-react-app, check out [Setting Up React Application using CRA](https://github.com/Learn-React-With-Harshi/chapter-14-machine-coding-interview/blob/main/setup.md)

Let's set up the project in quick time by following the steps below & spend all the time that we have for developing the features.

### Tech Stack:

- UI Framwork : React
- CSS Framework : Tailwind CSS
- Routing : React Router DOM
